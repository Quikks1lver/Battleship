# Battleship
Simple human v. computer Battleship text-based Battleship game, coded in Python.

**Note** There are two files: one does not include Python classes, the other does. For all intents and purposes, they perform the same. I just wanted to get more practice working with Python classes and objects which is why I revisited my earlier code to include a class-based version.
