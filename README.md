# Battleship
Simple human v. computer Battleship text-based Battleship game, coded in Python.

*Note*: there are two files. One does not include Python classes, the other does. For all intents and purposes, they perform the same. I just wanted to get more practice working with Python classes and objects which is why I revisited my earlier code to include a class-based version.

To run the program(s):
- Download the repo
- Ensure you have python 2 or 3 installed
- Run ```python[x] battleship.py``` or ```python[x] class_based_battleship.py```, where ```x``` can either be ```""``` (nothing) or ```3``` (for python 3)
- Enjoy!
