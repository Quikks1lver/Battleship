# Battleship
Simple human v. computer text-based Battleship game, coded in Python.

*Note*: there are two files. One does not include Python classes, and the other does. For all intents and purposes, they perform the same. (I just wanted to get more practice working with Python classes and objects which is why I revisited my earlier code to include a class-based version.)

To run the program(s):
- Download the repo
- [Ensure you have python 2 or 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Run ```python[x] battleship.py``` or ```python[x] class_based_battleship.py```, where ```x``` can either be ```""``` (nothing) or ```3``` (for python 3)
- Enjoy!

*P.S.: This was my first real foray into a substantial python program, as well as my first personal project, so I have a special place in my heart for this program. =]*
